Aims for this hack...

- As a user, I want to know when it is ok for me to turn on my various electrical appliances.
- The hack will provide a web page showing
 - Predicted Solar Generation, based on
   - Time of day
    - Cloud Cover
 - Which appliances are safe to turn on based on
   - How long they run for
    - Their power usage

So, the tumble dryer takes 2 hours and uses 1500W.  If the prediction for the next two hours is for less than 1500W/h the dryer icon will be red.

If the prediction is >= 1500W/h then the icon will be green.
